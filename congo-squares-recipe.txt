# Ingredients

2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2/3 cup butter, softened
2 1/4 cups brown sugar
3 eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla
2 1/2 cups chocolate chips


# Preparation

Pre-heat the oven to 350°F.

Sift the flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Set aside. Combine the butter and sugar using a mixer until blended. Add the eggs, one at a time, to the sugar mixture, mixing on low in between each addition. Add the vanilla and mix. Add the flour and mix until combined. Stir in the chips.

Coat a 9-inch x 13-inch pan with nonstick cooking spray and spread the batter evenly into the dish. Bake for 30 minutes, then cover the top with foil to avoid over-browning. Bake for another 10-15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out with moist crumbs. You will think they are under-done, but they aren't. Make sure you don’t overbake!
